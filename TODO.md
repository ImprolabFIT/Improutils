Here are various notes and question about the functions and their functionalities

 - `other.py - order_points()`:
   - is it supposed to work even for more points than 4?
   For example, shall the function restrict 6 points an invalid input?
 - in `image_features.py`, the functions have no description whatsoever. This MUST be fixed!
